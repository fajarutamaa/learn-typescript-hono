# Backend Development Learning Project

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive guide and hands-on experience for learning backend development using modern tools and libraries. The main technologies used in this project are Hono.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The goal is to provide a robust foundation for developers to build efficient and scalable backend applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Hono.js**: A minimal and fast web framework for building scalable and performant web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing better tooling and error checking.
- **Prisma**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database interactions and migrations.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **Other Libraries**: Additional libraries and tools will be used throughout the project to enhance development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of backend development:

1. **Setup and Configuration**: Initial setup, including project structure, installing dependencies, and configuring the environment.
2. **Routing and Controllers**: Setting up routes and controllers using Hono.js.
3. **Database Integration**: Integrating PostgreSQL with Prisma, including schema definition and migrations.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing user authentication and role-based access control.
5. **Error Handling and Logging**: Best practices for error handling and logging to ensure maintainability and debugging.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fajarutamaa/learn-typescript-hono.git
    cd learn-tyepescript-hono
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection string, secret keys).

4. **Run Database Migrations**:
    ```bash
    bunx migrate:dev
    ```

5. **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
